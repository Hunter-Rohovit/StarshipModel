# README
This project was started to pursue my own interests and to create a cool model for our class project! We had to design a Mission to Mars for my Honors Aerospace Engineering class, and I was with a group of a few other people tasked with transportation. For the rocket we chose SpaceX's Starship for its reusability capabilities and I was tasked with creating a 3D model of it. My teacher wanted to keep it, so now, this model still stands tall in the Aerospace Engineering Classroom.
